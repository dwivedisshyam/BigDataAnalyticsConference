				<h3 class="page-title" align ="">Call for Student Symposium </h3>
				<br><br>
				<p>The main objective of the symposium is to offer an environment for postgraduate students and research scholars working in the area of big data analytics to present their work, and exchange their ideas and experiences with peers. We invite PhD students in the early stages of their research (one - two years after registration) and M.Tech/Masters students working on their dissertations to submit an extended abstract (up to 6 Pages) for review by experts. The paper should clearly describe the goals, motivation, challenges and approach for the ongoing research. Plan for preliminary experimental evaluation should be included. Participants with interdisciplinary work across the areas are particularly welcome. The papers submitted for Student Research Symposium should have the student as the first author. Inclusion of supervisor(s) as co-authors is optional. Authors of accepted submissions are expected to participate in person to the symposium for presenting their work and subsequent discussion, preferably with the advisor. </p>
				<p>All submissions must follow the author instructions for regular research papers. If the work is nearly complete, then based on the merit of the work the committee may nominate the paper for consideration for the main conference. </p>
